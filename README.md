# Jonathan Sue's "Tweeter" Project (Lighthouse Labs)


## Background
This project was completed as part of the Week 3 requirements while I was a student in the Web Development bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs. Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. In this project, I did all of the CSS styling, as well as writing functions and event handlers using JavaScript, JQuery, and AJAX in order to asynchronously compose, submit, and retrieve tweets from a MongoDB database collection. Finally, I also did some rudimentary image editing in order to style the icons how I wanted them to appear.


## Functional Requirements

- Primarily a client-side Single Page App (SPA)
- The client-side app communicates with a server via AJAX
- Tweets are persisted to MongoDB and survive server restart
- Application can be viewed via Heroku or localhost
