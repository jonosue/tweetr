## NOTES  - Submission 03 <-- CURRENT

- I successfully deployed my app to Heroku in this iteration of my submission.

## NOTES - Submission 02

- Using Notify.js, I added a new script that handles how tweet error alerts are handled. In my opinion, it is a significant change for user experience.

## NOTES - Submission 01

- David VanDusen instructed our cohort that we did not have to copy the styling choices that were shown in the example images exactly to a tee. He encouraged us to modify elements such as colors, nav bar heights, button/form appearance, etc. in order to personalize the app to our liking. As a result, I did not copy the formatting/color choices exactly as shown in guide images. I put my own spin on it (including using the Twitter blue color!). I believe that I have the ability to emulate the screenshots, but I chose to not do everything exactly the same. That said, I did style elements as expected (for example, if the appearance of an element was to change upon hovering over it, I made sure to add different styles for hover states with styling as desired).
- Instead of using alert() boxes, which is the only thing that we have been taught for conveying information on page to a user, I decided to use Notify.js for displaying messages to the user if their tweet does not meet the requirements for submitting properly. The "alerts" will either disappear automatically after 3 seconds or when you click them. I judged 3 seconds to be enough time to read the content of the alert.
- I may submit again if I manage to add any "stretch" features to the project. This is a first pass that should satisfy all of the mandatory functional requirements.
